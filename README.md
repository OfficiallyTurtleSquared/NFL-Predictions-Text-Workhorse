Hi.

This is basically to help me make text templates. 

If you wish to use this, for whatever reason:

The main usage here is to generate a text readout of NFL matchups for the current week. 
I am not pulling the schedule from anywhere, this app is SOLELY to save me from typing team acronyms.

Step 1: Click the away team's logo

Step 2: Click the home team's logo

Step 3: Repeat until you have the whole weeks schedule

Step 4: Profit.


It's really that simple. If, somehow, you stumbled across this by accident, congratulations and I'm sorry.
